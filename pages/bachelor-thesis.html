    <h2>Bachelor thesis</h2>
    <p>My bachelor thesis topic was "Moving weighted least squares in Julia". My supervisor was <a href="http://kalvoda.org/">Tomáš Kalvoda</a>. The defense was quite successful and I obtained an A.</p>
    <p>The program lives in <a href="https://github.com/vutunganh/MovingWeightedLeastSquares.jl">Github repo</a>. The text is in <a href="https://github.com/vutunganh/MWLS-text">another repo</a> (only in Czech).</p>
